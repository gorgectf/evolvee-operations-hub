# Going live on Render + Netlify

How to switch the **already-deployed** hosted app from bundled sample data to real
API data. This is the production version of [sample-vs-live.md](_docs/setup-help/sample-vs-live.md). 
Instead of editing a local `.env`, you set environment variables on the Render service.

> First time deploying? Do [Step 8 — Deploying](_docs/setup-help/deployment.md) first.
> Come back here once the Render service and Netlify site are both live on sample data.

Each integration has its own switch, so you can go live **one source at a time** as
credentials arrive. Netlify serves the same frontend build either way; almost all the
work is on Render.

---

## 1. Add credentials + flip the mode on Render

Render Dashboard → your `operations-hub-api` service → **Environment**. Add the
variables for the source you're enabling, then set its `*_MODE` to `live`.

| Source | Set mode | Credential variables to add |
|--------|----------|------------------------------|
| Shopify | `SHOPIFY_MODE=live` | `SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN` (e.g. `your-store.myshopify.com`), `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_TOKEN` (`shpat_…`), `SHOPIFY_API_VERSION` (e.g. `2025-04`) |
| Zoho CRM | `ZOHO_CRM_MODE=live` | `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`, `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`, `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN` (defaults for `ZOHO_ACCOUNTS_BASE` / `ZOHO_API_BASE` are fine) |
| AfterShip | `AFTERSHIP_MODE=live` | `AFTERSHIP_API_KEY` |
| QR partner | `QR_PARTNER_MODE=live` | `QR_PARTNER_API_BASE`, `QR_PARTNER_API_KEY` (leave at `placeholder` until access is confirmed) |

Credentials come from the account owner. Variable names and inline notes are all in
[backend/.env.example](backend/.env.example).

Saving an environment change on Render **redeploys the service automatically** — no
manual restart. Leave any source you don't have credentials for on `sample` /
`placeholder`; the rest still work.

---

## 2. Verify it connected

- Open the app and check the **sync status** indicator. A live call that fails shows a
  sync-failure banner instead of silently serving stale data — the message names the
  source and error.
- Backend health: `https://<your-render-app>.onrender.com/api/health` returns `{ ok: true }`.
- Watch **Render → Logs** during the redeploy for any integration errors on first boot
  (the stock check runs on startup).

---

## 3. Netlify side

Usually nothing changes. The live switch is entirely backend. Just confirm, once, that
the two ends still point at each other:

- Netlify env var `VITE_API_BASE` = your Render backend URL, no trailing slash.
- Render env var `CORS_ORIGIN` = your Netlify site URL.

If you only changed `*_MODE` and credentials, you do **not** need to redeploy Netlify.

---

## 4. Rolling back

Set the source's `*_MODE` back to `sample` (or `placeholder` for QR) on Render and save.
It redeploys to bundled data. Credentials can stay set; the mode switch is what controls
live vs sample.

---

## Shopify-specific note

This store's variants have **no SKUs**, so stock levels are matched on Shopify's
`inventory_item_id`. For reorder thresholds and low-stock alerts to fire against live
data, each DB product needs its `shopify_inventory_item_id` set (or the inventory item id
entered as the product's SKU). See the Products & reorder thresholds page. Sales tiles
key on product title in live mode, since order line items also carry no SKU.

## Don't forget (from the deploy checklist)

- `AUTO_SEED` should be `false` after the first deploy seeded the admin user.
- Free Render Postgres **expires 30 days after creation** — move both resources to a paid
  `plan` in [render.yaml](render.yaml) before relying on live data.
